<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>Hi! I'm Robert Stefanic. I currently live outside of Chicago with my wife and dog, and I'm a developer at <a href="https://www.clubexpress.com" target="_blank">ClubExpress</a>.</p>
<p>I <em>love</em> computers and programming. I spend quite a bit of time reading books, articles, and papers on the topic ranging everywhere from boring and mundane, to exciting and inspirational. And while I'm far from the best, I do write a lot of code.
Despite reading widely about computers, I still have yet to find a topic about computers that I find uninteresting! This website mainly serves as an outlet for me to write about programming topics once I feel like I have an opinion that's worth sharing or I feel like I want to share something that I've learned.</p>
<p>Actually, that's a bit of a lie. It also serves as a place where I can share some photos that I've taken that I'm happy with.</p>
