        <p>I recently gave a talk at the Northwest Chicago JavaScript meetup on functions in JavaScript. I really wanted to explore functions in JavaScript because they had so many interesting characteristics such as the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>They have an array that you can use to access all of the arguments that were passed in</li>
<li>Functions can return functions and they can passed to other functions as arguments</li>
<li>You can change a function’s context using <code>bind</code></li>
</ul>
<p>All these characteristics made me want to learn more about JavaScript functions, and as I’m sure you can tell, it was a rabbit hole that kept going deeper and deeper. In the end, it turns out that functions in JavaScript are really just fancy objects! And this led me down an even more interesting path in learning more about JavaScript’s types and objects.</p>
<p>There’s a phenomenal book on the topic called <a href="https://nostarch.com/oojs"><em>Principles of Object-Oriented JavaScript</em></a> by Nicholas Zakas. I highly recommend this book if you’re interested in learning about objects in JavaScript.</p>
<p>The talk is available to watch below and the slides used in the talk are available <a href="https://github.com/rstefanic/digging-into-js-functions">here.</a></p>
