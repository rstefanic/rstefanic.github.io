I'm Robert Stefanic. I live in St. Petersburg, FL with my wife and dog. I'm the lead developer at National Flood Experts located in Tampa, FL.

Sometimes when I feel like I have something interesting to say or I feel like I need to remember something, then I'll write about it here. I also enjoy talking about these topics in front of an audience if the opportunity presents itself.
